Minimal Functionality.py is the minimal required code for -
random stat gen. It also includes the ability to select how many -
characters you desire. 
Simply copy the output afterwards.

Gui on the otherhand does not, you have to click per character.
And copy method is by copying from stat_file.txt.

Anyway, this was a neat project but personally I'd use the MF one.
